# Assignment 12: Meta-Analysis

Create a new Word document in your assignments folder called ***assignment_12.docx***. In this document, document your answers to the questions below. Include output/figures from your analyses as needed to support your answers.


Assignment questions:

1.	Identify a relationship that you have an interest in meta-analyzing. I would prefer it be something that has not been meta-analyzed before and you may find it easier if it is a correlation rather than a group difference, odds-ratio, etc.
    * Briefly explain why you think meta-analyzing this relationship is important and what a meta-analysis may be able to do to add to this literature.

2.	Do a Google Scholar search on the relationship.
    * How many results were returned?
    * Provide the citations for the first ten (10) primary data, empirical articles you found and the sample size (N) and correlation (r) from each. You need at least ten studies... so if need be, expand your inclusion criteria. For example, if you wanted to do entrepreneurial grit and venture performance and only found 4 studies, then expand your inclusion criteria to include entrepreneurial resilience, persistence, or expand your outcome variable to be any positive outcome of grit (e.g., satisfaction, firm size). However, one sample, one effect size. If a study reported grit and 5 different measures of performance, that’s not 5 effect sizes. Just choose one and move on.
    * Report your coding in a table: 3 columns and 11 rows. The column headers will be “Citation”, “N”, and “r”. The ten rows after that are your coding results.

3.	The correlation of interest will differ across these 10 studies. What are the methodological and substantive factors you believe might account for this variation?

### When finished and ready to submit:
1. Save your file
2. Commit and push it to your GitHub repository.
3. Verify that the file appears in your GitHub repository and looks correct.
4. Create an issue with the submitted label in your GitHub repository and assign it to me.

*If you do not recall how to do this, revisit the assignment from [week 1](./workflows_resources.md)*

### If concerned regarding privacy in putting your name in the GitHub-uploaded assignment: send me an email with the assignment attached with your name in the assignment so I can grade it.
