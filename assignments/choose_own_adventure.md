# Assignment 15: Choose Your Own (Methodological) Adventure

Create a new Powerpoint document in your assignments folder called ***assignment_15.pptx***. In this slide deck, prepare a short (15-20 minute) presentation about the methodological approach outlined in the article you selected for our reading list this week. Your presentation should include the following elements:

1. A brief overview of the methodological approach used in the article.
2. Consideration of what kinds of research questions this approach is best suited to answer.
3. A discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the methodological approach.
4. A discussion of key methodological decisions to be made when using this approach (and how to approach making these decisions).

Either during or following your presentation, you should lead a discussion with the class about the strengths, weaknesses, and key methodological decisions associated with the approach used in the article.

### Notes:
* You should not simply read excerpts of the article to the class. Instead, you should provide a high-level overview of the methodological approach used in the article and then lead a discussion about the strengths, weaknesses, and key methodological decisions associated with this approach.
* You should prepare slides to guide your discussion/presentation. These slides should be professional and (reasonably) visually appealing.

### When finished and ready to submit:
1. Save your file
2. Commit and push it to your GitHub repository.
3. Verify that the file appears in your GitHub repository and looks correct.
4. Create an issue with the submitted label in your GitHub repository and assign it to me.

*If you do not recall how to do this, revisit the assignment from [week 1](./workflows_resources.md)*

### If concerned regarding privacy in putting your name in the GitHub-uploaded assignment: send me an email with the assignment attached with your name in the assignment so I can grade it.
