# High Performance Computing

## Due MONDAY night so they have plenty of time to prepare their response to the queries before our class

Your assignment for this week is to email me the following items:

* a list of a few questions you have about high performance computing to pass along to our guest speaker.
* confirm that you have watched the video
* confirm that you are able to log into Research Desktop - either having thinlinc installed on your computer or have used it on the [website](https://red.uits.iu.edu).
* confirm that you will bring a laptop to class on Wednesday (they can be borrowed from the library if you do not have one).

No github submission is required for this week.
