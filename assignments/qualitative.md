# Assignment 9: Qualitative Methods

Create a new Word document in your assignments folder called ***assignment_9.docx***. In this document, document your answers to the questions below. Include output/figures from your analyses as needed to support your answers.

## Qualitative Methods

Find a qualitative research article of your choosing (it can be from any field). Summarize the article and discuss the following:
1. What is the method used and how is it described/employed?
2. What questions are the authors trying to answer and how do they justify the method based on those questions?
3. How are findings presented (i.e., Tables, Figures, etc. used)? What purpose do figures/tables serve?
4. Compare and contrast how the contribution of the paper is set up, and the structuring of the paper (Introduction, Theory, Findings, Discussion) compared to quantitative studies.
5. What steps do the authors take to ensure the trustworthiness of their findings?

If you would like to use a qualitative article from your own research, that is ideal. If you are having trouble finding a qualitative article, here are a few famous ones that use a variety of qualitative methods:
