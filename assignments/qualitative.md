Assignment Questions:

You will be assigned one of the articles from this week. Please answer the following questions from the particular article and be prepared to discuss your findings with the class (you must read ALL the articles, but will only be responsible for answering the following questions with respect to one).

1.	What is the method used and how is it described/employed?
2.	What questions are the authors trying to answer and how do they justify the method based on those questions?
3.	How are findings presented (i.e., Tables, Figures, etc. used)? What purpose do figures/tables serve?
4.	Compare and contrast how the contribution of the paper is set up, and the structuring of the paper (Introduction, Theory, Findings, Discussion) compared to quantitative studies.

### When finished and ready to submit:
1. Save your file
2. Commit and push it to your GitHub repository.
3. Verify that the file appears in your GitHub repository and looks correct.
4. Create an issue with the submitted label in your GitHub repository and assign it to me.

*If you do not recall how to do this, revisit the assignment from [week 1](./workflows_resources.md)*

### If concerned regarding privacy in putting your name in the GitHub-uploaded assignment: send me an email with the assignment attached with your name in the assignment so I can grade it.
