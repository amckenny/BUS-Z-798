# Assignment 14: Social Networks

Create a new Word document in your assignments folder called ***assignment_4.docx***. In this document, document your answers to the questions below. Include output/figures from your analyses as needed to support your answers.

## Social Network Methods

Find an empirical article that uses social network methods of your choosing (it can be from any field). Summarize the article and discuss the following:
1. What network-related theory/hypotheses are the authors testing?
2. How wouth this study be classified in terms of the type of network analysis (see the Carpenter et al reading)? Why
3. Provide an assessment/critique of the methods decisions made by the authors related to the social networks aspect of the analysis. (Two of the readings this week articulate some of the strengths and weaknesses of social network methods. Use these to guide your critique.)
    * What are the strengths of the methods used?
    * What are the weaknesses of the methods used?
    * What was unclear about how the methods were articulated in the article?

### When finished and ready to submit:
1. Save your file
2. Commit and push it to your GitHub repository.
3. Verify that the file appears in your GitHub repository and looks correct.
4. Create an issue with the submitted label in your GitHub repository and assign it to me.

*If you do not recall how to do this, revisit the assignment from [week 1](./workflows_resources.md)*

### If concerned regarding privacy in putting your name in the GitHub-uploaded assignment: send me an email with the assignment attached with your name in the assignment so I can grade it.
