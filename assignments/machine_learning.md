# Assignment 11: Machine Learning

Create a new Word document in your assignments folder called ***assignment_11.docx***. In this document, document your answers to the questions below. Include output/figures from your analyses as needed to support your answers.

Work through this Google Colaboratory page: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16oQlQXitFRYyBJWMo42YaBZ6oAwUKp3Y

After completing the Google Colaboratory page, answer the following questions:

1. Compare the results from the dictionary-based approach to the machine learning approaches. Which one outperformed the other? Why do you think that is?
2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the machine learning approaches used in the Google Colaboratory page?
3. In organizational research, we examine multiple different forms of reliability and validity. How does this compare to the way machine learning models are evaluated? What are the implications of these differences for organizational research?
3. How might you use machine learning in your own research? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of using machine learning in your research?

### When finished and ready to submit:
1. Save your file
2. Commit and push it to your GitHub repository.
3. Verify that the file appears in your GitHub repository and looks correct.
4. Create an issue with the submitted label in your GitHub repository and assign it to me.

*If you do not recall how to do this, revisit the assignment from [week 1](./workflows_resources.md)*

### If concerned regarding privacy in putting your name in the GitHub-uploaded assignment: send me an email with the assignment attached with your name in the assignment so I can grade it.
