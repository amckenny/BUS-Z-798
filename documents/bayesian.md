# Bayesian Methods

Reading List:

Suggestions regarding readings: *There is some duplication of content among these readings. This is hard to avoid because this is a class of methods that are generally unfamiliar to many management scholars, so when an article talks about Bayesian methods, they often have to hit a lot of the same points to ensure that people know what they're talking about if they haven't read others in the area. When you get to content that seems repetitive from the other readings, skim it and make sure you're not missing anything, but don't feel like you have to read every word of every article. The Kruschke book is a good place to start to make sure you understand the basics. Then you can use the articles to get a sense of how these methods are being used in management research.*
