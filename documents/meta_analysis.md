## Week I
Assignment questions:

1.	Identify a relationship that you have an interest in meta-analyzing. I would prefer it be something that has not been meta-analyzed before and you may find it easier if it is a correlation rather than a group difference, odds-ratio, etc. Briefly explain why you think meta-analyzing this relationship is important and what a meta-analysis may be able to do to add to this literature.

2.	Do a Google Scholar search on the relationship. How many results were returned? Provide the citations for the first ten (10) primary data, empirical articles you found and the sample size (N) and correlation (r) from each. You need at least ten studies so if need be, expand your inclusion criteria. For example, if you wanted to do entrepreneurial grit and venture performance and only found 4 studies, then expand your inclusion criteria to include entrepreneurial resilience, persistence, or expand your outcome variable to be any positive outcome of grit (e.g., satisfaction, firm size). However, one sample, one effect size. If a study reported grit and 5 different measures of performance, that’s not 5 effect sizes. Just choose one and move on. Report your coding in a table in Word. Create 3 columns and 11 rows. The column headers will be “Citation”, “N”, and “r”. The ten rows after that are your coding results.

3.	The correlation of interest will differ across these 10 studies. What are the methodological and substantive factors you believe might account for this variation?

## Week II

Review the Meta-Analytic Reporting Standards: http://www.apastyle.org/manual/related/JARS-MARS.pdf

Assignment questions:

1.	Revisit the data you coded last week. Identify two potential moderators in the dataset—one continuous, one binary. These don’t have to be theoretically driven so it’s fine to use date of publication, percentage of females in sample, US versus non-US, etc. Next, make sure to have the metafor package in R and your data saved as a .csv file. The file should have rows and columns as before, but two additional columns, “cont.mod” and “cat.mod”.

2.	In your own words, what is the difference between a confidence interval and credibility interval? What are the types of questions they each answer?

3.	Identify a published meta-analysis (MA) on a topic of interest to you.
a.	Evaluate the quality of the research question(s) they are trying to address. What value does the systematic review/MA provide to the debate about the relationship they studied?
b.	Evaluate their methods and results sections using the APA’s Meta-Analytic Reporting Standards and, if they used meta-regression, Gonzalez-Mulé and Aguinis’s recommendations. What did the researchers do right and what did they do wrong?
c.	What would you recommend to those authors in terms of improving and extending their work?
