Notes:
* The assignment of topics to weeks is subject to change until the links become active (at least two weeks in advance) - I am working on getting guest experts to come in and talk about some of these topics, and their availability will dictate the schedule.
* Discussion leadership assignments are posted to Canvas so that students' names are not posted on this publicly available repository.
